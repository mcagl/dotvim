* BACKUP YOUR ACTUAL CONFIGURATION (don't blame me if you mess everything.)
* Then remove ~/.vimrc, ~/gvimrc, and the ~/.vim/ directory

* mkdir -p ~/.vim
* cd ~/.vim
* git clone git://gitorious.org/mcagl_dotvim/mcagl_dotvim.git .
* ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Enjoy! :-)

# Removed submodules things, because I now manage all the plugins as git repositories under bundle/
# Removed wget step, because autoload/pathogen.vim now is in the repository
# Now my vim configuration is handled by Vundle, not pathogen, so I removed stuff around, and now
  it seems a saner way to manage everything.
