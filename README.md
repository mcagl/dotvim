# My Vim setup

This setup uses Shougo's NeoBundle plugin manager, and I'm mainly targetting my needs for python and django development.


## Please NOTE:
* BACKUP YOUR **CURRENT** CONFIGURATION (don't blame me if you mess everything.)
* Then remove `~/.vimrc`, `~/.gvimrc`, and the `~/.vim/` directory


## TODO:
* Write some documentation on installation, now that I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
